# Employee Management System

Employee Management project built with MERN and Redux


## Database Design
Use **MongoDB** for data store and management.  

Onlu one model is needed in the Employee Manegement system: **Employee**.

A possible Employee Schema may look like this: 

``` javascript
const HeroSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  sex: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  startDate: {
    type: Date,
    required: true
  },
  officePhone: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  cellPhone: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  email:  {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  manager: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  dirReports: {
  	type: Object,
  	required: true
  }
  numberOfDirReport: {
  	type: Number,
  	required: true
  }
});
```
#### Database Explanation:  

 * name: 	employee's name, string
 * title: employee's title, string
 * sex: employee's gender, only three selections available
 * startDate: employee's start working date at company, Date
 * officePhone: employee's office phone, string that only in the right firmat
 * cellPhone: employee's cell phone, string that only in the right firmat
 * email: employee's email, must be in the right email format
 * manager: employee's manager, a string which is the maneger's _id generated by MongoDB
 * dirReports: employee's direct reports, an array which are all the reports' _id generated by MongoDB 
 * numberOfDirReport: the number of employee's direct employee

### REST API

Use express router to handle data request, create and update.  
The employee's router's url is '/api/employee'.  
It can be used like this:  
> const employee = require('./routes/api/employee');  
> app.use('/api/employee', employee);  

In the employee router, it has 4 functions: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.  

* GET: 
	* ' / ': get all the employees, retuan as an Array
	* ' /:id ': get certain employee, retuan as Employee
* PUT: ' / ': add new employee to the database
* POST: ' /:id ': update existed employee to the database, when update is called and executed successfully, the database should update all other employee's relation with the deleted employee
* DELETE: ' /:id ': delete existed employee to teh database, when delete is called and executed successfully, the database should update all other employee's relation with the deleted employee

  
## UI Design and React Component

Use **Material UI** to do the UI design.  
For the React components, Reacr Router will be used to navigate through pages.  

* ' / ': home page which will show all the employees, by clicking the employee can go to employee detail page
	* ' /:employeeId ': employee detail page which will show the employee detail
		* ' /:employeeId': detail info of employee manager, not available if no manager
		* ' /:employeeId/reports': all employee's direct reports

For the components hierarchy, it may look something like this:

* Home Page
	* Infinite scroll
	* Header
	* Search Bar
	* Add button 
	* List of employees (--> Employee Detail)
 
In home page, we can navigate to employee detail page by clicking the employee list.

* Employee Detail
	* Back button  
	* Basic info 
	* Manager info (--> Manager(Employee) Detail)
	* Direct reports info (--> Direct Repoorts Detail)
	* Other info

In Employee page we can go to Manager detail page and Direct Reports page.

* Direct Reports
	* Back button
	* List of direct reports info (-->Employee Detail)
